Its an intelligent trained system to provide users of a database with recommendations on movies, based on heuristics derived from their past ratings, closest neighbourhood etc. 
I use two basic recommendation techniques over here viz. Content based and Collaborative. In addition to these I finally use the generated results and combine the two techniques into a hybrid technique of Weighted Recommender system.
The movie lens dataset has been used.The training and testing both has been done on the 100k dataset.
